            <!-- JD: Depending on the design and intent of your jQuery plugin,
                     having the developer spell out these elements may or may
                     not be a good choice.  I know you have not "wrapped" your
                     code into a plugin yet, but that is part of the issue:
                     design decisions like this really should be made by you
                     first, before diving into the code. -->
            <input checked type = "checkbox" id = "enter"/>
            <!-- JD: You misspelled "label" in the line below. -->
            <lebel> Send when "enter" is clicked</label>
            <!-- JD: The hardcoded positioning here is a sign that this
                     is probably best left to the plugin code, so that the
                     layout/positioning can be automated and not be prone
                     to user error.  Then again, you might choose the user to
                     control exactly where the draggable elements should go,
                     in which case the code below may be acceptable.  The whole
                     issue is that your intent is not known; there is neither
                     documentation about it, nor do your design choices send a
                     clear signal on what code will be the plugin's responsibility
                     and what code will be the developer's. -->
