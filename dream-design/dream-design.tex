Interfaces and their designs are considered necessity in our daily technological use of modules that can be applied on a hardware, or a software.  Moreover, the interface between a user and a machine, has to be built based on some guidelines, principles, and theories of interface designs, that allow the user to have a better experience when using those interfaces.  However, in this paper I will mention my dream interface that can be applied as a software in a specifically designed machine, which therefore has to follow certain guidelines and principles of design that are going to be mentioned. So what is my dream interface?
\paragraph{}
Since we are all surrounded by so many hard objects in our lives, and those objects sometimes are needed to be shown exactly as they are on a computer or a tablet so they can be illustrated or modified in a way or another. Therefore, what I have always dreamed of is a 3D scanner from your own computer, tablet, or phone's screen. The screen can work as a scanner which scans any object you place it in front of it, to an exact 3D model of it in the software that you're using.
