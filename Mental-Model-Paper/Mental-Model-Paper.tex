 \section{Introduction}
In this paper we will be discussing, the definition, history, and the latest offerings the new technology that is called Second Screen has come up with. Also, we will discuss how this new technology relate to guidelines and principles of interaction design. Which, with the results of some recent studies, we will conclude if Second Screen technology might, or might not make the current way of interacting with visual media take a new turn to be widely used, and more interactive, and enjoyable by the users in the future. \paragraph{}
However, what is Second Screen?  "A second screen is a second electronic device used by television viewers to connect to a program they're watching. A second screen is often a smartphone or tablet, where a special complementary app may allow the viewer to interact with a television program in a different way."\cite{Second-Screen-Def}
 \section{Background}
 Second Screen technology has become more known, and used in the past two years, where most of the famous TV prod-casting companies have implemented the technology in either one, or more of their own shows.  Also, as we all know that Xbox, Wii, and PS3 have also have used some compatible devices with second screens in them, to enhance the user experience when interacting with the main screen.
 However, since we briefly defined what a Second Screen is, let us now explain how, and what kind of ways people can use them.
